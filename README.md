# API
Based on the provided requirements, we can use Python and the Flask framework to develop the APIs. Here's an demonstration of it.,


Install Flask and pandas:


Create a new Python file, and import the required modules;


Load the dataset CSV file into a pandas DataFrame:
Initialize the Flask application:
app = Flask(__name__)
Implement API 1: Total items sold in Marketing for the last quarter of the year:
Implement API 2: Nth most sold item in terms of quantity or price:
Implement API 3: Percentage of sold items department-wise:
Implement API 4: Monthly sales for a specific product:
Run the Flask application:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
    Additionally, we can customize the API functions and add necessary error handling, input validation, and documentation based on your specific requirements.
